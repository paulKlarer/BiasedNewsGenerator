The goal of the project was to learn about LLM fine tuning and raise attention for fake news.

# BiasedNewsGenerator

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the voluntary course "Machine Learning and AI." We built a pipeline that fetches news from the Tagesschau API and selects a topic, which is then processed by our custom fine-tuned LLM model.

Our fine-tuned model has been trained on several hundred articles collected from far-right media sources. After preprocessing these articles and generating a Q&A dataset, we fine-tuned the model to improve its ability to rewrite these articles while incorporating their inherent bias.
